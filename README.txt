I created a function called calculate that takes three parameters: two numbers and a string representing the operation ('add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide').
Inside the function, I used switch cases to perform the appropriate operation based on the input string and return the result.
I validated that the input numbers are valid (not null or undefined) and that the operation is one of the allowed strings.
I tested my function with different sets of inputs.
